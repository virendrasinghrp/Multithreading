/**
 * This is an actual interview question asked at Netflix.
 * Imagine we have an Executor class that performs some useful task
 * asynchronously via the method asynchronousExecution() . In addition the
 * method accepts a callback object which implements the Callback
 * interface. the objectâ€™s done() gets invoked when the asynchronous
 * execution is done. The definition for the involved classes is below:
 *
 * public class Executor {}
 * public interface Callback {}
 *
 * The main thread exits before the asynchronous execution is
 * completed.
 * Your task is to make the execution synchronous without changing the
 * original classes (imagine, you are given the binaries and not the source
 * code) so that main thread waits till asynchronous execution is complete.
 * In other words, the highlighted line {System.out.println("main thread exiting...");}
 * only executes once the asynchronous task is complete
 * */
